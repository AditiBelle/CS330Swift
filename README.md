## __HISTORY__: 

Swift was first announced at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in 2014, making it a relatively new language. Its development first began in 2010 by a team over at Apple led by Chris Lattner with Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, and Joe Groff. The reason for developing Swift was to ease up the process of app development for Apple's devices. Prior to the release of Swift, this process was done through Objective-C. The objective to switching over to Swift was to make programming more accessible and faster in addition to reducing chances of error. 



## __VARIABLES & DATATYPES__: 

Swift has several reserved words. Linked right here is the entire list of the reserved words in the langauge in order for you to reference: https://swiftbydeya.com/swift-keywords/
Swift's keywords are crucial to how the language functions and are used for declarations, statements, expressions, types, patterns, bitwise operators as well as some reserved for particular contexts. 

In order to name variables in Swift, they must start with either a letter, _, or a $. They CANNOT start with numbers. The language is also case-sensitive, so two variables with the same name but different capitalizations (ex. hello & Hello) are different variables. 

Swift is statically-typed, meaning that every single object is checked while the code is compiling, rather than on run-time. This makes Swift more efficient as a langauge and easier to debug. 

In addition to being efficient, Swift is also strongly-typed, meaning that when you set a vraible, Swift checks during compiling, if the variable is the correct type. 

Operators available for each datatype in Swift are:

Arithmetic Operators: 

Assignment Operators: 

Comparison Operators: 

Logical Operators: 

Bitwise Operators: 

Ternary Operator: 

Nil-Coalescing Operator: 

Range Operator:
